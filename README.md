# üß† Alzheimer's Classification using Custom ConvNeXt (COMP3710 Task 8)

**Author:** Thomas Preston  
**Course:** COMP3710 ‚Äì Pattern Recognition  
**Task:** 8 ‚Äì Recognition (ConvNeXt Implementation from Scratch)  
**Date:** October 2025  

---

## Overview

This project implements a **ConvNeXt-style convolutional neural network from scratch** to perform binary classification of brain MRI scans from the **ADNI dataset**, distinguishing between **Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD)** and **Normal Control (NC)** patients.

The implementation follows the **Task 8 specification**, which requires students to build a ConvNeXt model manually (without using pretrained weights or `torchvision.models.convnext`).  

The model is trained and evaluated on MRI images using modern deep learning optimization techniques to improve stability, speed, and generalization.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a curated subset of the **ADNI (Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)** collection, consisting of preprocessed 2D MRI slices.

| Split | Samples | Description |
|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| Train | ~21,000 | Used for optimization (85 % of total data) |
| Validation | ~3,200 | Used for model selection (15 %) |
| Test | 9,000 | Unseen evaluation set |

# üß† Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Classification using ConvNeXt

**Author:** Thomas Preston  
**Course:** COMP3710 ‚Äì Pattern Recognition  
**Task:** 8 ‚Äì Recognition Problem (Hard Difficulty)  
**Date:** October 2025

## Overview

This project implements a **ConvNeXt-based convolutional neural network** from scratch to classify **Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD)** versus **Normal Control (NC)** brain MRI scans from the **ADNI (Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)** dataset.  

The work satisfies the *Recognition Problem #8* requirement from the COMP3710 specification, achieving a minimum test accuracy of ‚â• 0.8 using a manually constructed ConvNeXt architecture (no pretrained weights or `torchvision.models.convnext`).  

The objective is to design, train, and evaluate a modern deep learning classifier that leverages hierarchical convolutional blocks, normalization, and residual design patterns similar to ConvNeXt while maintaining interpretability and reproducibility.

---

## Problem Statement

Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by structural brain changes observable in MRI. Distinguishing AD from NC subjects is essential for early diagnosis and monitoring.  

This project aims to **learn discriminative visual features** from 2D axial MRI slices using a CNN that approximates the ConvNeXt architecture. The classifier outputs the probability of an image belonging to either class:  
\[
P(y = \text{AD} \mid x), \; P(y = \text{NC} \mid x)
\]

## How the Algorithm Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture

The model follows the **ConvNeXt-Small** design pattern:  
- **Patch embedding** ‚Äì Initial convolution with stride 4 to create patch tokens.  
- **Stage blocks** ‚Äì Four hierarchical stages of depth-wise convolutions, GELU activations, and LayerNorm, mimicking the ConvNeXt design.  
- **Residual connections** to improve gradient flow.  
- **Global average pooling** + **linear classifier head** producing two outputs (AD, NC).  

> Implemented entirely in `modules.py` as the class `ConvNeXtBinary`.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading and Preprocessing

- Implemented in `dataset.py`.  
- The loader scans the `ADNI/AD_NC/` directory structure:
  ```
  ADNI/AD_NC/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
    ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AD/ # Alzheimer's MRI scans
    ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NC/ # Normal control MRI scans
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
    ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AD/
    ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NC/
  ```
- Each `.nii` or `.nii.gz` MRI slice is:
  - Loaded via **Nibabel**.
  - Intensity-normalized to zero mean, unit variance.  
  - Randomly augmented (rotation, noise, cutout) for robustness.  
  - Converted into 3-channel tensors (for compatibility with ConvNeXt blocks).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Training and Evaluation

Training script (`train.py`) handles the full loop:
- **Optimizer:** AdamW  
- **Scheduler:** Cosine annealing  
- **Loss:** Cross-entropy  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy & ROC-AUC  

During training:
- Epoch losses and validation accuracy are plotted (`train_plot.png`).  
- Best model saved as `best_model.pth`.  
- MixUp regularization is applied for smoother decision boundaries.

> Typical configuration: 30 epochs, batch size = 16, learning rate = 1e-4, weight decay = 1e-3.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction and Visualisation

`predict.py` loads the trained checkpoint and:
- Performs inference on random test samples.
- Prints predicted labels and probabilities.
- Optionally visualises samples:

```bash
python predict.py --model_path best_model.pth --num_samples 5
```

Example output:

```
File: AD_013.nii.gz | Prediction: AD | Confidence: 0.94
File: NC_102.nii.gz | Prediction: NC | Confidence: 0.89
```

## Dataset

| Split | Samples | Description |
|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| **Train** | 18 292 | 85 % for model optimization |
| **Validation** | 3 228 | 15 % for model selection |
| **Test** | 9 000 | Held-out evaluation set |

**Source:** ADNI dataset (preprocessed 2D MRI slices)  
**Path on Rangpur:** `/home/groups/comp3710/ADNI`

## Pre-Processing Summary

| Step | Technique | Purpose |
|:----|:-----------|:--------|
| Intensity Normalization | (x ‚àí Œº)/œÉ | Remove scanner intensity bias |
| Random Rotation (¬±15¬∞) | Data augmentation | Increase invariance |
| Gaussian Noise | Regularization | Prevent overfitting |
| Random Cutout | Data augmentation | Encourage robustness |

**Justification of Splits:**  
An 85 / 15 train‚Äìvalidation split was chosen to balance generalization with sufficient training data. The test set is completely unseen to ensure reliable evaluation.
